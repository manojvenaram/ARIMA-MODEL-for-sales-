# Time Series Analysis with ARIMA Models

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for performing time series analysis using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models. The code includes data loading, model fitting, visualization of results, and evaluation of forecasts.

## Files
- **arima_time_series_analysis.py**: Python script containing the code for time series analysis.
- **sales.csv**: Sample dataset containing monthly sales data.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
- scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib statsmodels scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run the `arima_time_series_analysis.py` script:
   ```
   python arima_time_series_analysis.py
   ```
4. The script will load the dataset, fit an ARIMA model, plot the time series, visualize residual errors, perform forecast evaluation, and plot the forecasts against actual outcomes.

## Dataset
The `sales.csv` file contains monthly sales data. It should be structured with two columns: `Date` (representing the time period) and `Sales` (representing the sales quantity for that period).
